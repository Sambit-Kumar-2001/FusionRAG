# FusionRAG

### A Production-Style Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

FusionRAG is a production-inspired **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines **semantic vector search and keyword retrieval (BM25)** with **cross-encoder reranking** to produce accurate answers grounded in source documents.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how modern AI systems retrieve knowledge, rank relevant context, and generate reliable responses with **traceable citations**.

---

# Problem Statement

Many simple RAG implementations rely only on vector similarity search. While effective for semantic matching, vector search often struggles with:

* Exact keyword queries
* Technical terms
* Domain-specific vocabulary
* IDs and structured references

FusionRAG addresses this limitation by implementing a **Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline** that combines:

* Dense semantic retrieval (vector search)
* Sparse keyword retrieval (BM25)
* Cross-encoder reranking for final relevance scoring

This architecture reflects patterns commonly used in **enterprise AI systems**.

# Retrieval Pipeline Explanation

### Hybrid Retrieval

Two retrieval strategies operate simultaneously:

Vector Retrieval
Uses dense embeddings and FAISS to retrieve semantically similar documents.

Keyword Retrieval
Uses BM25 to retrieve documents containing exact keyword matches.

Results from both retrievers are combined using a **weighted scoring strategy**.

---

### Cross Encoder Reranking

The top 20 retrieved chunks are passed to a cross-encoder model that evaluates query–document relevance.

The system then selects the **top 5 most relevant chunks**.

---

### LLM Generation

The final context documents are passed to the language model, which generates an answer grounded in the retrieved sources.

Each response includes **citations referencing the original documents**.

---

# Future Improvements

Planned improvements for this system include:

* Automated RAG evaluation using RAGAS
* Observability and latency monitoring
* Token usage and cost tracking
* CI pipeline for evaluation regression testing
* Advanced chunking strategies
* Streaming responses for real-time interaction

---

# Project Goal
